# So you want to build a recipe site...

Well, that's how this site started. This post will contain the instructions on how I created this site from scrath.
The reason it was created from scratch with minimal frameworks (other than [Aurelia](Aurelia.io)) is so that anybody
can look at the site and say,
> Hey! That's what I need to do!  

And they'll be able to look at how it was done. Good luck!
