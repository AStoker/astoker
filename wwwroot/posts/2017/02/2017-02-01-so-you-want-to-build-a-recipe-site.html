<template><h1>So you want to build a recipe site...</h1>
<p>Well, that's how this site started. This post will contain the instructions on how I created this site from scrath.
The reason it was created from scratch with minimal frameworks (other than <a href="Aurelia.io">Aurelia</a>) is so that anybody
can look at the site and say,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hey! That's what I need to do!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And they'll be able to look at how it was done. Good luck!</p>
